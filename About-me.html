        <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>I used to be
          a pack rat.</strong> I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the
          truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too
          much.<br> Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I
          didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.<br><br>
          <h2>How Iturned things around </h2>
          <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid
          of everything. </strong>I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage,
          sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.<br>
          It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad
          place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.<br><br>
          <h2>Now I live the
          simple life </h2> Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much
          better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more
          free time to enjoy.<br> With how much it turned my life around,<strong>I felt
          like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it, </strong> and how others
          can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started
          this site!
