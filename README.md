# Responsive web app

This is basic static website created using only html and css.

This project is part of [freecodecamp's](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp) youtube tutorial [Introduction To Responsive Web Design - HTML & CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvUrASNj0s&list=WL) by [Kevin Powell](https://github.com/kevin-powell).

This was fun project.
